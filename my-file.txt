what i've learnt so far on git is how to first of all, clone a repository to my local computer after it's been created on the remote, cd into that repository, create branches apart from the master branch which is automatic, add file and make a commit after staging the file. somany other things like merge two different branches together, push from local to remote repository and make a pull request. There are somany things i've learnt and more is yet to be unraveled and i open my mind to it as it come. Thanks to the best mentorin the world"My Guru"
